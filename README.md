### About this article

The article states that although every software developer are aiming to achieve complicated and exciting software programming, they should not ignore the fact that developing software needs time and carefully following the steps. Rushing a project and will results in mistakes and failure. Developing software should be like a marathon that each developer should save their energy and be prepared to work for a long time. Moreover, the passages suggests that reboundant meetings that does not consider user's feedback may be a waste of time as it may drive the team to distraction and wrong orientation. In addition, developers should be cautious of making mistakes since it would be hard to fix later in the process.
This article is useful as it warns us that we should not get too excited and rushed through the process. Getting bored in the middle of the steps is inevitable and we, as developer, should accept it and progress steadily.

The points raised have my full support. Software development requires a plan at all times, and even if the task is completed ahead of schedule, the developer should never rush!
