The article states that although every software developer are aiming to achieve complicated and exciting software programming, they should not ignore the fact that developing software needs time and carefully following the steps. Rushing a project and will results in mistakes and failure. Developing software should be like a marathon that each developer should save their energy and be prepared to work for a long time. Moreover, the passages suggests that reboundant meetings that does not consider user's feedback may be a waste of time as it may drive the team to distraction and wrong orientation.
